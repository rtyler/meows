= Message Exchange Over Web Sockets üêà

This crate implements the simple pattern needed for implementing
service-to-service message exchange over WebSocket connections. Users of meows
can handle typed JSON message with the option for a default handler for any
un-typed messages.


All messages intended to be handled must be wrapped in a meows appropriate
envelope described below:

.Envelope
[source,json]
----
{
    "type" : "ping",
    "value" : {
        "msg" : "Hey kitty kitty"
    }
}
----

Which would then be mapped to a struct such as:

.Rust code
[source,rust]
----
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct Ping {
    msg: String,
}
----

In essence, anything that serde can deserialize, can be passed through meows.
